    This week has been all about react component and functions. Saying and is has been overwhelming is an understatement.
    It has literally been intense trying to actually "master" all of the topics


    What were the most challenging topics?

    Honestly everything... The most challenging probably have been react-router since l just havent figured it out completely without help but l will revisit it.

    Workload: How many times hours per week?

    I would say about 12-15 hrs this week and this includes the lessons aswelll. I had to revisit a lot of the topics that we had previously went through and watch the videos before beginning class.

    Any suggestions?

Not much to be honest since there so much material so the class tempo has to be fast. Some FAQ like anwers perhaps since there have been some common issues that many people have had and l am guessing some people are too shy to speak Up.
