    Jesper: He has the most programming experience of the group and it shows especially during the group activities and he has helped a lot in the group when the rest of us have faced a bug or a problem in code.

Me: i have been active in the group and l even got a Google authetication button to our program to login. and in out group l have been in charge of the the UI aswell and created some great design in Figma and then implemented those tothe codebase. 
Reflection

Challenges Faced:

This week, I encountered challenges, particularly during Activity 2. I personally struggled with grasping the concepts.

What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

Despite the challenges, I successfully completed the coding tasks related to the useReducer() and useContext() topics. Through these difficulties, I learned the importance of seeking help when needed and the value of perseverance in mastering new concepts.

Key Learning:

This week, I acquired valuable knowledge in two crucial React concepts: useReducer() and useContext().

    useReducer(): I learned how to manage complex state logic in React applications more efficiently using the useReducer() hook. This concept has significantly improved my ability to handle state changes and data flow within my projects. It enables me to write cleaner, more maintainable code by centralizing state management and actions.

    useContext(): Understanding and implementing useContext() has been a game-changer for me in terms of handling global state and making it accessible across different components. It has streamlined the way I pass data and functions down the component tree, reducing the need for prop drilling and enhancing the overall organization of my React applications.

These new concepts have expanded my toolkit as a developer, empowering me to build more robust and scalable React applications while maintaining clean and readable code. I'm excited to apply these learnings to my upcoming projects and continue honing my skills in these areas.

Soft Skills Development / Academic Progress:

Throughout this week, my soft skills, particularly communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, played a significant role in my progress. I found that effective communication with my teammates helped streamline our project discussions, and it allowed us to resolve issues more efficiently. Collaborating with others allowed us to bring diverse perspectives to the table, enhancing the quality of our work. Moreover, my problem-solving skills came into play when we encountered unexpected challenges during the projects.

Project Management:

This week, I integrated agile project management principles into our project work. Embracing flexibility and adaptability was key to our success. We regularly reviewed and adjusted our project goals and tasks, which allowed us to respond swiftly to changing requirements. This agile approach improved our collaboration as we remained responsive to each other's feedback and needs throughout the projects.

Final Thoughts:

Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm genuinely proud of my contributions to the Web Course and Project Course. Every obstacle we faced became an opportunity for personal and professional growth. I'm genuinely excited about the prospect of continuing to build my skills and knowledge.

Next Steps:

In the upcoming week, I plan to delve deeper into specific areas of interest, with a primary focus on React website development. I'm particularly enthusiastic about exploring and mastering the useReducer() and useContext() functionalities. These concepts will be instrumental in improving the state management and user experience of our projects. I can't wait to dive into these topics and apply them to our ongoing work with a sense of eagerness and determination.
