    Open Feedback: Task Managerc in my opinion is way too simple in this case and since there rae so many tutorials for this and a lot of people have done this so many times.  The UI is stunning tho and the frontend is really good on this one.

    Open Feedback: Tasklist is a pretty simple task and with a lot of different tutorials online and not much of revolutionary stuff since that is the type of project with the likes of like Notion it is hard to compete.
