- Reflection

This week has been a rollervoaster a little bit due to some personall stuff which has made it a lot harder to study and to be focused.

    Key Learning:

Key points that l have learned this week are the event loops in which you had the setTimeout to manage which code would be read first

Online Resources:

codecademy.com

Also the given videos from the e-mails helped a lot

Academic Progress:

[Evaluate your academic progress for the week, discussing completed assignments, grades received, and areas where you've improved.]

    Soft Skills Development:

Project Management:

I would say that my soft skills are one my strong suits in life since l have been doing a alot of groundwork with my team to get everyone to come out of their shell and be more vocal and active.

Not to sound arrogant but I am the most naturally extrovert in our group and by doing so l am really the person that is always leading the conversation and it has been nice seeing this rub off on my group members and they can be more open now than in the beginning.

Final Thoughts:

I need to work on my programming a lot but so far l have been playing catch up since l had to come back after a lot time of not coding it seeems quite challenging

Next Steps:

Next week my goal is to be as good as possible in classes and master the concepts that we have been going thruough previously.
