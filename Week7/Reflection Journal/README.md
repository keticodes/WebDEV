Reflection Journal for Week 7

Student Name: Keti 

Week 7 Self-Assessment:

During Week 7, I would rate my performance as a [Rating on a Scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest]. I
 believe my performance was at 3 because this week l did not feel like my best or even close to it and i know i have to improve in so many areas the i am not the best at...

- Evaluate your progress and performance during Week 7.

In Week 7, I made significant progress in several key areas. I successfully completed the following tasks:

1. **Pair Programming Activity:** I engaged in pair programming activities with my teammate whose name l unfortunately forgot but we finished the activity but the only thing that was not perfect wat the fact that the tests came out as failures but the rest was good. and other group members, Akseli, Jesper, and Miro. Our collaboration was highly effective, and we achieved our coding goals efficiently and got our project to work and to a point that is was good enough to be handed in but further modification will be done before presentation. 

2. **Effective Communication:** Communication with my team through Discord was excellent. Everyone in the group consistently maintained open and clear communication, which contributed to our overall success.

3. **Overall Group Performance:** I would rate all my group members, including myself, a 5 on a scale of 1-5 for their ability to collaborate, their roles in the tasks, their motivation, and overall contributions to our project. Everyone played a crucial part in our group's achievements.

Week 7 Achievements and Challenges: Challenges are on the testing since l felt my code for testig was not good enough and the tests came out as failures but the rest was good and the comprohension of mocha and Jest weree pretty good so I can be happy about that for now. 

Week 7 presented both achievements and challenges for me:

Challenges Faced:

- **Programming Skill Challenges:** This week, I encountered difficulties in certain programming tasks. Some complex coding challenges were a bit overwhelming and required additional effort and research.

- **Feeling Overwhelmed:** At times, I felt a little overwhelmed due to the workload and the complexity of the tasks. However, I learned to manage this feeling through effective time management.

What Went Well and Lessons Learned: l pair programming went well and I was really sick on the previous pair programming so more info about that. 

Achievements:

- **Effective Collaboration:** I am pleased with how well our group worked together. My teammates, Akseli, Jesper, Miro, and Munish, all contributed positively, and communication through Discord was smooth.

- **Pair Programming Success:** My pair programming sessions with Munish and others were productive. We tackled coding problems efficiently and learned from each other's insights.

Lessons Learned:

- **Coding Resilience:** Facing programming challenges taught me the importance of resilience and persistence. I learned not to be discouraged by difficulties but rather to see them as opportunities for growth.

Key Learning:

Throughout Week 7, I gained valuable insights into the following key areas:

- **Agile Project Management Principles:** I continued to apply agile project management principles in our group work. This approach helped us stay organized, prioritize tasks, and adapt to changes effectively.

Online Resources:

I found the following online resources useful during Week 7:

Chatgpt
Codeacademy 
Net Ninja (Youtube)

Coping Strategies:

- **Time Blocking:** I started using time-blocking techniques to allocate specific time slots for different tasks, which improved my time management.

Academic Progress:

- I successfully completed all assignments and received satisfactory grades.
- I noticed improvement in my understanding of the course materials.

Soft Skills Development:

My soft skills, such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, played a vital role in my progress. Effective communication with my team facilitated our collaboration, and problem-solving skills helped us overcome obstacles.

Project Management:

Agile project management principles continued to influence our approach to project work. These principles ensured that we remained adaptable and efficient in our group tasks.

Final Thoughts:

Looking back on Week 7, I'm proud of the progress I've made. Despite facing challenges, I have grown as a student and a team member. I see each challenge as an opportunity to learn and improve. As we move forward, I am excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.

Next Steps:

For the upcoming weeks, my goals and intentions include:

- **Focused Learning:** I plan to dedicate more time to improving my programming skills and addressing areas where I faced challenges.
- **Enhanced Time Management:** I will continue to refine my time management techniques to balance my responsibilities effectively.
- **Effective Collaboration:** I aim to maintain the high level of collaboration and communication with my team while striving for even better results. This was all be done by the end of the course and the presentation.
