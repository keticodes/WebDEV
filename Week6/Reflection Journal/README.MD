    Pair programming

I did the pair programming with Antti and l feel like l could have been better but Antti was definately the Brains in the session when we did the pair programming feels like he was 5 steps ahead and l understand that comes from experience but it was a eye opening expeerience for sure. 

In this l think being the Navigatoris more that than to be the one who actually codes since the Navigator has to see the entirety of the codebase to make it as effecient as possible. 

I would give Antti the highest grade possible for this excercise. 

    Group review

Akseli: The person who writes a lot of code to our project while l or Jesper for example navigate. 

Jesper: Always helping others since he is the most experienced coder of the group and it shows especially when doing the activities.
  
Miro: A little bit on the silent side but always with a good attitude towards doing the group assignments and project. 

    Reflection

    Challenges Faced:
    I challenged with the pair progmamming a bit and l feel like the comprehension in classes was tough since the flow from a information is vast and to apply it immediadiately was a challenge in the activities but l did the guided ones after initially trying on my own. 

    What Went Well and Lessons Learned: 
After some issues in the pair programming we did get it to work and l learned a lot from Antti and l feel like l have a better understanding of the codebase now. 

    Weekly Reflection

Positive was getting all the assignments done and the pair programming was a good experience.
I need to improve in many areas but l am so much bettter thab when l started. 
 
    Key Learning:

What l have leaarned about the login authentification is that it is a lot more complicated than l thought it would be. Hashing the password and then comparing it to the database is a lot more complicated than l thought it would be but decrypting it is relatively easy and that has made me to be more cautious with my passwords. 

    Online Resources:

my online resources have been Youtube and especially the videos from the course. and The Net Ninja. 
I also have been doing a lot of research on the internet to find out how to do certain things.

    Academic Progress:

Improved in group work and l futher improved my coding skills. and understating on building more complex applications. 

    Soft Skills Development:

This week l have learned to be more direct with my communication so that we can get the project to move forward. there is a lot to be done considering we only have 2 weeks left on this project so the clock is ticking on us. 

    Project Management:

[Discuss how agile project management principles influenced your approach to project work and collaboration this week.]
Final Thoughts:

Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the [Web Course] and [Project Course]. Every challenge presented an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.
Next Steps:

my goal for the next week is to go through the code
